My name is Muhammad Bilal Butt, I am COE major, I am from Pakistan, but have lived 8 years in Beijing China. Technology as whole has always been a hobby of mine, since a young age I was always the one out of family and friends of know how to use things when they came out and the one people would go to asking about anything related to technology. Keeping up to date to anything computer related is a major point of my day, as the first thing I do it open up sites like engaget, verge and gizomdo.

I am CoE major currently but plan to switch to EE, as in the last few years solar energy and renewable energy has interested me a lot. I still plan of pursuing computers related studies but on my own, as I believe that if I put my time in it I can learn coding on my own.

I have done a bit of coding as I took 2 years of Computer Science in School, with taught java, I have also taken 1 year of web design in school and have at times created sites and forums just for fun. I learned web languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript but it has been a few years since I really used them and I hope to use this class as a chance to refresh my memory and learn more about web design.
